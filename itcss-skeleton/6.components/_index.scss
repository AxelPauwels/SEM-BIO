/**
A component is a small feature that makes up a part of the app.Buttons, accordions, sliders, modal dialogs,â€¦
Each component is fully functional by itself and does not rely on other components

Note: If you use a component based framework like Angular or React,this layer will be empty since the components are already isolated and encapsulated
