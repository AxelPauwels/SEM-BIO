/**
A component is a small feature that makes up a part of the app. Buttons, accordions, sliders, modal dialogs,…
Each component is fully functional by itself and does not rely on other components

Namespace: c
Examples: c-btn, c-icon, c-masonry, c-link-underlined

Note: If you use a component based framework like Angular or React, this layer will be empty since the components are already isolated and encapsulated
