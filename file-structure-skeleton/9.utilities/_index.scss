/**
Sometimes you want to make changes only for a certain style in a specific place. In that case utility classes can help without changing the whole CSS structure

Because this is the last layer containing styles who should always win, you are allowed to use !important here

Like scope classes, if you are using too many utility classes,you should check with designer if the design can be more consistent across the app
